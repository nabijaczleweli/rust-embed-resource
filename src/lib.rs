//! A [`Cargo` build script](http://doc.crates.io/build-script.html) library to handle compilation and inclusion of Windows
//! resources in the most resilient fashion imaginable
//!
//! # Background
//!
//! Including Windows resources seems very easy at first, despite the build scripts' abhorrent documentation:
//! [compile with `windres`, then make linkable with `ar`]
//! (https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/cargo-update/commit/ef4346c#diff-a7b0a2dee0126cddf994326e705a91ea).
//!
//! I was very happy with that solution until it was brought to my attention, that [MSVC uses something different]
//! (https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/cargo-update/commit/f57e9c3#diff-a7b0a2dee0126cddf994326e705a91ea),
//! and now either `windres`-`ar` combo or `RC.EXE` would be used, which was OK.
//!
//! Later it transpired, that [MSVC is even more incompatible with everything else]
//! (https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/cargo-update/commit/39fa758#diff-a7b0a2dee0126cddf994326e705a91ea)
//! by way of not having `RC.EXE` in `$PATH` (because it would only be reasonable to do so),
//! so another MSVC artisan made the script [find the most likely places for `RC.EXE` to be]
//! (https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/cargo-update/pull/22), and the script grew yet again,
//! now standing at 100 lines and 3.2 kB.
//!
//! After [copying the build script in its entirety]
//! (https://github.com/thecoshman/http/commit/98205a4#diff-a7b0a2dee0126cddf994326e705a91ea)
//! and realising how error-prone that was, then being [nudged by Shepmaster]
//! (https://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/35378953#35378953)
//! to extract it to a crate, here we are.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! For the purposes of the demonstration we will assume that the resource file's name
//! is "checksums.rc".
//!
//! In `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! # The general section with crate name, license, etc.
//! build = "build.rs"
//!
//! [build-dependencies]
//! embed-resource = "1.1"
//! ```
//!
//! In `build.rs`:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! extern crate embed_resource;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     embed_resource::compile("checksums.rc");
//! }
//! ```

/// Compile the Windows resource file and update the cargo search path if we're on Windows.
///
/// On non-Windows this does nothing, on non-MSVC Windows, this chains `windres` with `ar`,
/// but on MSVC Windows, this will try its hardest to find `RC.EXE` in Windows Kits and/or SDK directories
/// (because rustc supports VC++ without being in a VC++ dev environment, so we have to as well).
///
/// # Examples
///
/// In your build script, assuming the crate's name is "checksums":
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// extern crate embed_resource;
///
/// fn main() {
///     // Compile and link checksums.rc
///     embed_resource::compile("checksums.rc");
/// }
/// ```
